This is the HTML and JavaScript code for data entry. It's been optimized so that you can just click the most common headlines, and others they always appear besides, to enter instead of typing every headline manually.

There is also a bar to type a custom headline, which you can then add with the button next to it or by pressing the Enter key.

TO USE THIS:
------
1. Download the <b>tocbuttons.html</b> file
2. Open something that can run HTML or double click it that usually does it
3. If you do not know how to do that, Google how to run an HTML file
4. Profit

IF YOU WANT THEM SEPARATE FOR SOME REASON:
-----
1. Download both the <b>buttondoc.html</b> and <b>buttonfiles.js</b> files
2. Open some sort of program that can run both of them at the same time. This is what I used to create them: <https://jsfiddle.net/>
3. Add them to their respective areas. This will depend on what you use, but if you are using <b>JSFiddle</b> (the above link), there are sections to import both into. HTML and JavaScript should be the only sections you modify (and modify them by pasting their respective scripts).
4. <b>Run</b> the program
5. Profit
